# Introduction

🧠 D2KLab Explorer is a web-based **exploratory search engine** for RDF-based **Knowledge Graphs**.

⚙️ The application can be **configured** in order to adapt to different information domains, **customizing** both the UI components and the queries made for retrieving the information.

🔍 It includes a **full-text search** and a **facet-based** advanced search.

❤️ Users have the ability to create lists of **favorites** items modelled in the Knowledge Graph.

💅 Check [existing websites](/showcase) already being powered by D2KLab Explorer.
